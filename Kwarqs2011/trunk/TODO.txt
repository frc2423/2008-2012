
Things to get done before competition
======================================

    (done) - Need some mechanism to calibrate based on top and bottom of elevator
    (done) - Need to have a 'go to the X and hold' mode for the arm
        (done) - Top, bottom needed for autonomous, methinks
    (done) - Adjust autonomous mode to drop sooner for longer period of time?
        (done) - Add a print statement IM DROPPING DA BOMB
        - Maybe autonomous mode adjusts distance based on drop time?

    - (done) Netconsole for driver station
        - What kind of output is going to be useful in the competition?

    - Better autonomous options?
        - Autonomous mode selection during disabled mode?
    
    - Add documentation
    
    - Add logging stuff for autonomous mode! Or, in general, whatever
        - Non-blocking io
        - What kind of things is it going to be useful to log?
        - Anything worth graphing?
        - Is there a python graphing library? That would be sweet. :) 
        
    - (done) Protection against exceptions killing the robot if the FMS is
    attached
        
    ... ooh. What about.. a logging data structure? start at autonomous
    mode, then dump after autonomous mode ends
    
    - (done) A basic set of unit tests is needed because... 
        - We need to make sure that we have something to quickly
        run at the competition when we make changes to ensure things
        aren't too terribly broken. Syntax errors and such too. 

    - Think on this problem of reversing the thump motor on accident
