
1. Mount arm tasks:
    - Replace encoder on pulley
        - Test to see that the encoder values are consistent
    
    - Ensure that arm can be elevated & controlled properly
        - Ensure elevating code works properly
        - Check switching between manual and automatic mode

2. General tasks:
    - Calibrate light sensors on field
    
3. Autonomous tasks:
    - Simulate a full autonomous mode in the pit
        - In particular, see if the arm positioning does
        the right thing if you get too close
