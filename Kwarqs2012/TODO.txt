Things we *need* to get done before the Boston Regional:

    - Need to develop a checklist of things to do when we get to the regional
        - Tuning tasks, electrical tasks, program verification tasks, etc

    - Autotune PID Control for shooter wheel
        - This is what the wheel_test program is for!
        - Youssef is working on this
            - Decided this wasn't going to happen, manual tuning instead
        
    - Integrate Vision processing into driver station
        (done) - No more basket tracker python module, so use the network tables instead
        - Need integration with robot python code
    
    - Verify logic for high-level automated systems
        (done) - Ball handler
        - Robot Manager
        
    - Verify shooter operation
        - Figure out how this even works, with manual and automated shooting mechanisms
        
    - Verify susan operation
        - Not even clear if we really know how this is supposed to work automatically
            - How do we deal with the vibration/slippage?
        - The latency is really going to kill us since we don't know where it is
            - We need options with/without the gyro, just in case
    
    - Non-classmate operator computer
        - Someone needs to set this up with Win7 and the right software
        - Need to install the vision stuff on it too
        
    - Operator console
        (done) - Need to finish design for this, implement it
        (done) - Need to add code that can operate the LEDs
            - Need to add shooter digits
        
    (done) - Operator Controls
        (done) - We still haven't specified how this works yet, need to finalize it
        (done) - Document controls, implement controls that make sense
        
    - Autonomous modes
        - We need to figure out which ones we're going to do
        - Implement a test for each so we know they work before we get there

        - Potential modes needed:
            - Shoot balls while pulling in more balls from teammates
                - Need to be able to adjust frequency of shooting interval, just in case
            - Feed balls back to teammates
                - Need to do this at a particular frequency, how does the sensing work?
                
        Student code ideas:
        
            *if in expel to team mate(s) mode*
            --> expel balls. Once all balls are shot, head over to ramp and knock balls off
            
            *CODE*
            feeder.Expel
                if 
            '''
            
            
            '''
            if in autoshoot mode
            --> aim and shoot balls. Once all balls are expelled (+ a time 
            interval passes) head over to ramp and knock balls off
            
            *CODE*
            robotManager.ShootIfReady()
            
            
        
    - Add SmartDashboard functionalities
        - Chooser to pick the autonomous mode!
            - This is important
        (done) - PID Tuning?
        - Feedback for all robot systems
        - Neat idea: custom widget to display status on the robot in real time?
            - Even without a custom widget, we probably should feed all the sensors
            and states and stuff back to the SmartDashboard!
            
    (done) - Investigate SmartDashboard/NetworkTables
