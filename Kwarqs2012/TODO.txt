Things we *need* to get done before the Boston Regional:

    - Need to develop a checklist of things to do when we get to the regional
        - Tuning tasks, electrical tasks, program verification tasks, etc

    - Autotune PID Control for shooter wheel
        - This is what the wheel_test program is for!
        - Youssef is working on this
        
    - Integrate Vision processing into driver station
        - No more basket tracker python module, so use the network tables instead
        - Sam is working on this
        
    - Non-classmate operator computer
        - Someone needs to set this up with Win7 and the right software
        - Need to install the vision stuff on it too
        
    - Operator console
        - Need to finish design for this, implement it
        - Need to add code that does the right thing here
        
    - Operator Controls
        - We still haven't specified how this works yet, need to finalize it
        - Document controls, implement controls that make sense
        
    - Autonomous modes
        - We need to figure out which ones we're going to do
        - Implement a test for each so we know they work before we get there

        - Potential modes needed:
            - Shoot balls while pulling in more balls from teammates
                - Need to be able to adjust frequency of shooting interval, just in case
            - Feed balls back to teammates
                - Need to do this at a particular frequency, how does the sensing work?
    
    - Verify robot logic
        - We probably need to state precisely how these work, and create
        tests that make sure that they do that
        
    - Verify shooter operation
        - Figure out how this even works, with manual and automated shooting mechanisms
        
    - Verify susan operation
        - Not even clear if we really know how this is supposed to work automatically
            - How do we deal with the vibration/slippage?
        - The latency is really going to kill us since we don't know where it is
            - We need options with/without the gyro, just in case
        
    - Wrapper around PID Controller and jaguars?
        - enable/disable/manual modes need to be simplified so we don't screw it up
        
    - Add SmartDashboard functionalities
        - Chooser to pick the autonomous mode!
            - This is important
        - PID Tuning?
        - Feedback for all robot systems
        - Neat idea: custom widget to display status on the robot in real time?
            - Even without a custom widget, we probably should feed all the sensors
            and states and stuff back to the SmartDashboard!
            
    - Investigate SmartDashboard/NetworkTables
        - What latency does this introduce?
        - What other kinds of cool things does this allow you to do?
        

    - Test framework improvements
        - Need to add SmartDashboard stuff to it, even if it doesn't actually work
        - Needs to be a way to automatically verify that things are working! Otherwise
        the tests are useful... but not really all that useful
        - Verify that motors are only set once per loop?
