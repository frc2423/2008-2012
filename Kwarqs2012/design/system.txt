Various components of the robot, and associated sensors:

    Shooter:
        Wheel:
            - CAN Jaguar + CIM Motor
            - CAN Jaguar + CIM Motor
            - US Digital Encoder 
                -- attached to Jaguar
                -- may need an isolation circuit to hook it up to both Jags.. 
            
        Angle Adjustment:
            - CAN Jaguar + Motor
            - Magnetic absolute angle encoder 
                -- attached to Jaguar
            - Do we need limit switches for extremities? 
        
        Lazy Susan:
            - CAN Jaguar + Vex Motor
            - Vex Motor Encoder
            - 2 limit switches for each extreme of the lazy susan rotation
                -- attached to Jaguar
            - Gyro for angle sensing
        
        Camera:
            - Camera
            - Servo
        
    Chamber:
        - Jaguar + Motor
        - Ball detection (1 ball):
            - Distance sensor or limit switch (maybe both?)
    
    Feeder:
        - Jaguar + Motor
        - Ball detection (2 balls):
            - Distance sensor or limit switch
            - Distance sensor or limit switch
    
    Ramp Arm:
        - Relay + Motor
        - Limit switch
    
    Drivetrain:
        - PWM Jaguar + CIM
        - PWM Jaguar + CIM
        
    Other:
        - Perhaps put distance sensor at feeder entrance to detect incoming?
        - Additional Gyro for angle sensing
