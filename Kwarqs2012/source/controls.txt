Due to the complexity of our robot, for this year's controls we want to
have automated and manual systems mesh together with little thought 
required for the drivers to make this work. 

In particular, enabling or disabling automated behaviors must never 
cause the controls to change in a surprising way.

These can be expressed by these rules:

- When a enable switch is on, automated behaviors occur
- If a button is pressed, then a specific behavior is forced to occur
- The action that occurs is identical whether an enable switch is
on or off


Digital inputs (switches):
    
    Camera:
    
        Auto distance enable/disable
        Auto susan enable/disable
        
    Wheel enable/disable
    Continuous Feed enable/disable
    Auto ball handler enable/disable
    
    
    
TODO: Fix these
 
Stick1:

    X/Y axis drives robot
    Trigger: smoother turning
    
    6/11: Ramp arm down
    
    Z axis: manual camera angle
    Top button: enable manual camera pointing
    
Stick2:

    Shooter:
        Trigger: fire ball (move ball from chamber)
            if auto ball handler or wheel is on:
            wait until wheel is correct speed before moving
            
        if wheel enabled:
            Z axis: set manual wheel speed
            
    Susan:
        if Top button:
            X axis: turn lazy susan
                
            
    Ball Handling:
        
        6/7: manual chamber 
        10/11: manual feeder
            -- continues for 1 second if auto ball handler is on, to catch
            any balls that might have been collected
    
        


Outputs: 
    Green LED: 
        If off, nothing
        If blinking quickly, then shooter is running
        If solid, then ready to shoot
        
        
    Left digits:
        Current target for shooter speed (automated or manual, doesn't matter)
        
    Right digits:
        Current measured shooter speed
